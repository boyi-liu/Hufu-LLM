        "question": "Five food companies sponsored a local food bank. Foster Farms donated 45 dressed chickens; American Summits donated twice the number of bottled water than the number of dressed chicken donated by Foster Farms; Hormel donated three times the number of dressed chickens that Foster Farms donated; Boudin Butchers donated one-third of the number of dressed chickens that Hormel donated; Del Monte Foods donated 30 fewer bottles of water than American Summits. How many food items did the companies donate in total?",
        "answer": "American Summits donated 45 x 2 = <<45*2=90>>90 bottled waters.\nHormel donated 45 x 3 = <<45*3=135>>135 spams.\nBoudin Bakery donated 135 x 1/3 = <<135*1/3=45>>45 sourdoughs.\nDel Monte Foods donated 90 - 30 = <<90-30=60>>60 canned fruits.\nTherefore, a total of 45 + 90 + 135 + 45 + 60 = <<45+90+135+45+60=375>>375 different food.\n#### 375"

        "question": "Frank needs to meet a quota at work for his sales. It\u2019s the beginning of the month and in 30 days he needs to have 50 cars sold. The first three days he sold 5 cars each day. Then the next 4 days he sold 3 cars each day. If the month is 30 days long how many cars does he need to sell for the remaining days to meet his quota?",
        "answer": "On days one, two, and three he sold 5 cars each day so, 5 cars + 5 cars + 5 cars = <<5+5+5=15>>15 cars that he sold on those days.\nOn days 4,5,6 and 7 he sold 3 cars each day so, 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars = <<3+3+3+3=12>>12 cars that he sold on those days.\nNow we combine the cars he has already sold, which is 15 cars, and 12 cars, so 15 cars + 12 cars = <<15+12=27>>27 cars are sold in total.\nIf he needs to sell 50 cars and has already sold 27 cars then 50 cars - 27 cars = <<50-27=23>>23 cars left to sell to meet his quota.\n#### 23"

        "question": "Jean is wanted on 3 counts of arson, 2 burglary charges, and six times as many petty larceny as burglary charges. If each arson count has a 36-month sentence, each burglary charge is 18 months and each petty larceny charge is 1/3rd as long as a burglary charge, how many months in jail is Jean facing?",
        "answer": "First find the total time for the burglary charges: 18 months/charge * 2 charges = 36 months\nThen find the total time for the arson charges: 3 counts * 36 months/count = <<3*36=108>>108 months\nThen find the time per larceny charge: 18 months / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 months\nThen find the total number of larceny charges: 2 charges * 6 = <<2*6=12>>12 charges\nThen find the total time for the larceny charges: 6 months/charge * 12 charges = 72 months\nThen add up the time for all the charges to find the total jail time: 36 months + 72 months + 108 months = <<36+72+108=216>>216 months\n#### 216"
